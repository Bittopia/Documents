# San Cristobal - Mexico \| Jan 2020

The following document outlines the various feedback, outcomes, and thoughts regarding the DAOfest event that was organized in the city of San Cristóbal on the 23rd of January, 2020.

Proposal for the event: [https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x8990e11b69403ea53ef2b32434bbd7dbf84b5234/proposal/0xfa82ce95416f201405d1c3f541210c742b0cab0ad4a6ac1890f3d3e37d9adfb3](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x8990e11b69403ea53ef2b32434bbd7dbf84b5234/proposal/0xfa82ce95416f201405d1c3f541210c742b0cab0ad4a6ac1890f3d3e37d9adfb3)

## Goal

This workshop and session will provide DAOfest with a template that can be used by other members to host their own workshop, thus increasing the level of awareness and opening up the education framework for others to review and contribute to.

Improving the curriculum and allowing people to gain from the wisdom of the crowd is a big part of this initial workshop. The curriculum has been put together and will mark the first step in building a decentralized and open education platform, which can be translated and used by anyone in the world while ensuring quality control by using the wisdom of the crowd.

## Location Background & Importance

This city is a very important place. San Cristóbal is situated in the state of Chiapas, where the [Zapatistas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation) took form and reside, one of the most successful autonomous regions of our time. The population are well aware of the dangers of centralization and have suffered greatly from the hands of [Coca Cola](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/world/americas/mexico-coca-cola-diabetes.html) in particular. It would be amazing to have people learn about autonomy, decentralization, DAOs, and how they can be used to preserve culture and traditions, as well as allow others to collaborate and contribute to their cause.

This city also attracts a wide range of backpackers and open-minded individuals from all around the world.

## Procedure of the Workshop

### Curriculum

As a part of our initial approach, we decided to introduce a well-defined curriculum to help elevate the collective knowledge regarding decentralization, blockchains, decentralized cryptocurrencies, and decentralized autonomous organizations \(DAOs\).

This open-source curriculum can be viewed via: [https://github.com/BITTOPIA/curriculums/blob/master/intoduction%20to%20decentralization.md](https://github.com/BITTOPIA/curriculums/blob/master/intoduction%20to%20decentralization.md)

The curriculum was broken down into 7 modules. Most of the modules included an exercise that needed to be completed as a way of assessing and applying the theory. The following are the modules that were included in the workshop:

* **Module 0: Introduction to Decentralized Currency**
  *  Excercise 0: Download Telegram/join Telegram group for DAOfest Mexico \([https://t.me/DAOMX](https://t.me/DAOMX)\).
* **Module 1: How to Setup a Wallet**
  *  Excercise 1: Download Coinomi.
* **Module 2: Wallet Security 101**
  *  Excercise 2: Securely store your mnemonic phrase.
* **Module 3: How to Buy Bitcoin**
  *  Excercise 3: Sweep paper wallet, each loaded with 50 pesos.
* **Module 4: How to Send/Receive Funds**
  *  Excercise 4: Send funds to each other.
* **Module 5: Online Transactions**
  *  Excercise 5: Send funds to an address placed on the projector/TV screen.
* **Module 6: What is Ethereum?**
  *  Excercise 6: Download/setup Metamask.
* **Module 7: What is a DAO?**
  *  Excercise 7: Create a DAO on Aragon via testnet.

### Feedback

To get a better understanding of people's thoughts and motives, we decided to put together a feedback form that people could use to provide us with valuable information that could be used to better adjust the workshop for the future.

This feedback form also allowed us to explore the existing limitation within people's mind that has prevented them from exploring the possibilities of cryptocurrencies, decentralized tools, and decentralized applications.

The feedback form included the following questions:

**1. What do you think of Bitcoin?** **2. What has prevented you from using Bitcoin?** **3. What are some of your worries regarding Bitcoin?** **4. What are some of the benefits of Bitcoin / Blockchain?**

People were asked to answer these questions prior to the workshop--with the exception of the last question--so that we could gain an authentic response.

**5. How would you improve the workshop?**

## Questions From Our Students

During the session, several people had questions and concerns regarding various aspects of adoption:

* How would the average shop owner pay their staff and cover other aspects of their expenses if they were to accept Bitcoin?
* How do you pay your bills with Bitcoin?
* How would a person in Mexico deal with the fluctuations, given a small change can have a huge impact on the person's financial safety?

## Create Your Own DAO

The last part of the curriculum required that people gather in groups and brainstorm ways that a DAO could be created. The following are the various ideas that were suggested by the students:

* Book Club DAO: Rewarding for reading and sharing books.
* Musicians DAO: Helping artists and musicians.
* Workers Co-Op: everyone owns a part of a business.
* Agriculture: Creating solidarity, share tools, labour, and reduce struggle.
* Coffee farmers within Chiapas. Protect them from the industry. Tracking the coffee, logistics, its origin, and details of the farmer.

### Overall Analysis

Overall as seen in the below responses, most people lacked the knowledge and education when dealing with Bitcoin and decentralized tools, which can result in fear. This is why such an approach is essential to the overall growth and adoption.

We also categorized the data. This allowed us to see the relevant topics that we should focus on:

As seen from the above analysis, knowledge is the most important aspect when dealing with adoption and use.
