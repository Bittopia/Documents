## Background
To read our previous annual report please check the links below:

2022 marked our first year towards building momentum and expanding our network, each, and growth. 

Our main focus was on marketing, funding, and partnerships. We entered the year with the beginning of the bear market, which made raising funds more challenging for all projects.

Despite the challenges, we successfully won a grant with a well-known project called Swarm, partnered with a University out of Switzerland to co-create a course on DAOs, and successfully launched two courses where students were rewarded in accordance with our incentive model. 
	
In this document, we will explore these opportunities and highlight our future goals. 

## 1.0 Courses
Bittopia University launched 2 courses at the beginning of 2022. These included:

[![](https://bittopia-university.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/annual-report-22/bittopia-university-how-to-get-swiss-bank-your-pocket.jpg)](https://mybu.bittopia.org/courses/how-to-get-a-swiss-bank-in-your-pocket) [![](https://bittopia-university.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/annual-report-22/bittopia-university-reclaim-digital-privacy.jpg)](https://mybu.bittopia.org/courses/re-claim-your-digital-privacy-freedom/) 

To our surprise, the _Re-Claim Your Digital Privacy_ course was much more popular than than the crypto course, perhaps due to the current events around the world and the loss of privacy as a result.

Furthermore, the _Re-Claim Your Digital Privacy_ course consisted mostly of mothers who were concerned about the future of their children, wanting to know more about how they can protect their family from the constant introduction of new techs by Big Tech, many of which infringe upon peoples sense of privacy and freedom.

As one student mentioned in her feedback form:

>"This course has literally changed my life. I had no idea that I could have a private and secure identity online. I am moving forward confident that I can build on my learning and teach my children to be and stay digitally free…" - Bittopia Student from New Zealand

The summary of these courses can be found in the news section on Bittopia University's website, titled: The Innovative Curriculum and Educational Methods of the World’s First Decentralized University

### 1.1 Accessed by Students Across The Planet

Currently, we have students enrolled from various countries such as Australia, Malaysia, USA, New Zealand, Canada, and Singapore, and we expect to continue reaching people all over the world.

### 1.2 Incentivizing Education: BITX
In our system architecture, the token allows for the exchange of goods and services, and this is how Bittopia University rewards its students. Thus, the token facilitates access to information, payment for courses, and decentralized libraries, among others.

Students who support their peers through the learning process, successfully complete the courses or contribute knowledge will receive Bittopia’s native token, BITX, as a reward.

For example, through our masterclass, the prelude to our courses, we rewarded the people who were attentive, helping out their peers in the chat room, and those that demonstrated a keen ability for learning.

They were blown away to be able to use that reward to get a discount towards their enrollment. 

>As a part of the Bittopia framework, we incentivize the student process, reward contributors, and offer scholarships. 

> It is my pleasure Amanda based on your contribution and willingness to guide others during the class to offer you a scholarship for our next class or any future classes for the amount of $200 USD. 🎉💫 We will email you the details. 

>Thank you for your participation and contribution. 

>@MarciLaBelle @Sussannn and @cyd_mim based on your contribution and answering questions, which is tied to Bittopia's Proof of contribution, we are able to offer you a 20% discount for the course that will be starting in Jan 2022. We will email you the code to be used, should you wish to participate. 

This token allows them to access more benefits for their professional training. The better the students perform, the higher their digital reward. BITX is also the means of reward for those who want to contribute their knowledge, ideas, time, and resources.

## 2.0 Swarm Grant
>Congratulations for your successful participation in the grants program of the Swarm Association. On behalf of the Swarm Association's Council, it is our pleasure to inform you that your application for a grant has been approved.

We submitted a proposal to Swarm to participate in their grant, in the later stages of 2021. In July 2022 we heard back and were told that we were accepted and in the final stage of the grant program. After some discussion and a video call, we were approved and won a grant to develop a very important aspect of our system, our storage, on Swarm's network.

### 2.1 Fair Data Society
We had originally considered Storj, though their system architecture has gone through a lot of changes through the years, making it less appealing for our use. On the other hand, we do prefer and align with the [principles behind Swarm](https://fairdatasociety.org):

1. Ownership: All the data related to an individual are part of their digital self.

1. Zero-data: Privacy and non-collection of personal data should be default settings.

1. Control: The rights to data created about or by an individual are only their.

1. Consent: Individual’s data can only be accessed on the basis of consent.

1. Value: Data is a product of an individual’s labour and has economic value.

1. Responsibility: Personal data should be accessed on a need-to-know basis, annonymized before shared or monetised. 

1. Influence: Organisations allow the freedom of digital associations within the organisation's ecosystem and recognise associations outside.

1. Accountability: Organizations that access and process personal data provide clear, understandable, and explainable information.

1. Ethics: Organisations design their IT systems based on ethical handling of all personal data; ethics cannot be an afterthought.

1. Interoperability: Open source should be the ideal in as many cases as possible when new software is released.

### 2.2 Proposal

The proposal we had submitted to Swarm listed our desire to integrate their system for the purpose of storing student profiles, course metadata, as well as the course content itself (audio and videos). 

The following was our proposal:

>Bittopia is an online and in person educational platform. With an initial focus on educating around practical cryptography usage, Bittopia now supports courses for all subjects. Bittopia is designed to become increasingly decentralized and permissionless, to provide access to topics that may be subject to censorship in some regions or platforms. Beyond content hosting, course communication, and assignment grading, Bittopia will offer crypto credentials for those completing courses. 

>The default license for courses is Creative Commons but it is up to each educator to determine their own.


### 2.2.1 Swarm Course
A series of modules for Swarm, explaining its use case as well as how to get started developing with it.

Estimated time: 4 weeks following grant approval

### 2.2.2 Course Metadata

Course descriptions and metadata (dates, instructors, etc) are stored using Swarm.

Estimated time: 2 weeks following grant approval

### 2.2.3 Course Content

Course curriculum (assignments, and text lessons) are hosted on Swarm. 

Estimated time: 4 weeks following Milestone 1

### 2.2.4 Student Profiles

Student profiles are hosted on Swarm.

Estimated time: 4 weeks following Milestone 2

### 2.2.5 Video Hosting 

Bittopia's educators will be able to choose to upload their videos to Swarm via [Eterna](https://etherna.io/); providing a censorship-resistant alternative to YouTube. 

## 3.0 University Collaboration: FHNW Switzerland
Students of the FHNW University School of Applied Sciences and Arts were given access to the first-ever Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) course thanks to the collaboration with Bittopia University. The event marks a milestone for the education system, where traditional education merges with decentralized education in the name of knowledge.

### 3.2 Future Collaborations
The successful collaboration with FHNW marks our first step towards collaborating with other Universities that are open to enhancing their outdated curriculum and opening their doors to a new form of knowledge beyond their scope. 

## 4.0 Hackers Congress 2022 | Paralelní Polis

Bittopia University's founder and CEO, Amin Rafiee, was invited to speak at the [Hackers Congress](https://last-shot.hcpp.cz/) in Prague. This was his 8th year as a speaker. 

![](https://bittopia-university.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/annual-report-22/hcpp22-cover.png)


"Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis (HCPP) is the flagship event of Paralelní Polis, which since 2014 has been regularly attended by over 500 fans and IT experts from all over the world."

Amin Rafiee hosted a workshop at HCPP22, in which more than 50 people attended. Amin shared the curriculum to Bittopia's Digital Privacy Course and explained that ideas need to be translated into a format that people can easily understand and relate to. As most often people within the tech space have a hard time explaining things to people who non-tech minded.

## 5.0 Challenges & Opportunities
The downturn in the crypto market and global recession as made it challenging to raise capital. Though despite that we have pushed forward to continue our mission is decentralizing education and knowledge. 

No matter where we go, we see a great deal of interest towards our model and incentive protocol. The majority of people immediately grasp the benefits and necessities. 

On the other hand, some people have a hard time seeing Bittopia beyond what Udemy and Coursera are. Often people want to associate a new thing with something they already know. Though Bittopia is new in its design and as such, old ways of thinking cant render the Bittopia vision. 

The development of ChatGPT means that now we can start implementing an important part of our system architecture that we had predetermined, the course builder. Once this is implemented, people can easily interact with an ML/AI system that can assist them with building their course.

Moving forward, for the year 2023, we aim to connect with more Universities and organizations, offers more courses, expand the number of students we have enrolled, and apply for more grants to keep on building our decentralized architecture.
